          h1 Hi, I'm a professional Photographer based on Alex
          //- p First question you will ask when you know that is there is a web site all about me
          //- p "Why shall I read about him? What is special about him?".
          //- p I'm not special ,but my goal is being special at everything,
          //- p Which makes me glow anywhere.
          //- p No one knows everything about me , literally.
          //- p One of my side goals is being #[span mysteries],
          //- p At the first I thought that I can't, but I found out that I have
          //- p dark past and memories i won't let them see the light!
          //- p I am always good at giving advice ,but I am not good at all at working with them.
          //- p The photos will describe more  about my #[span Hidden Self].
          p A whole life can be taken in one picture !
          p you gotta know that every momment, every smile, every tear and every feeling are precious to me
          p Pictures since the beginning of the humanity meant so many things when the cavemen drew himself and his family it means that he existed before
          p When #[span Jean-Léon Gérôme] painted The #[i "Truth coming out of her well"] Painting we knew that we are living a lie
          p Pictures that do have the same ability to discribe like paintings but they are easier and more realistic.
          p In my site i will show you the power of the meaning in my own pictures I have taken.
