              //- p First question you will ask when you know that is there is a web site all about me
              //- p "Why shall I read about him? What is special about him?".
              //- p I'm not special ,but my goal is being special at everything,
              //- p Which makes me glow anywhere.
              //- p No one knows everything about me , literally.
              //- p One of my side goals is being #[span mysteries],
              //- p At the first I thought that I can't, but I found out that I have
              //- p dark past and memories i won't let them see the light!
              //- p I am always good at giving advice ,but I am not good at all at working with them.
              //- p The photos will describe more  about my #[span Hidden Self].

              p Hi, this is my Quote which helps me to survive and live in this world while being satisfied
              p you gotta know that every picture i have captured it i imagined it first
              p this how life works imagine , prepare, and do it.
              p Founding a real love was hard and harsh to me but now i got a real love
              p it is memories and putting it into a picture to bring it back in my imagination
              p it always makes life better and more beautiful .
              p My last words are advising you to pray and enjoy in this world
              p and don't forget that #[span pray] comes before #[span enjoy]
